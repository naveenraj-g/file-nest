"""
app.processing.pipeline — PipelineExecutor: coordinates all processing stages.

Receives a (file_id, organization_id, project_id) triple from ProcessingWorker,
loads the file and project config, downloads bytes from storage, runs each stage
in sequence, and writes the final status + outbox event in a single DB transaction.

Stage selection based on project_configs flags:
  virus_scan_enabled = True  → VirusScanStage runs first
  MimeValidationStage        → always runs
  ClassificationStage        → always runs last

Outcomes:
  All stages pass             → status=ready,       emit file.ready
  VirusScanStage finds virus  → status=quarantined, emit file.quarantined
  Any stage fails (mismatch)  → status=failed,      emit file.processing_failed
  Unhandled exception         → status=failed,      emit file.processing_failed

Usage:
    from app.processing.pipeline import PipelineExecutor
    executor = PipelineExecutor()
    await executor.run(file_id, organization_id, project_id)
