"""
app.routers.projects — HTTP handlers for project management.

Routes are thin: validate input, call ProjectService, return typed response.

Routes registered at /v1 prefix:
    POST   /v1/projects              create a new project
    GET    /v1/projects              list projects for the caller's organisation
    GET    /v1/projects/{id}         get a single project
    PATCH  /v1/projects/{id}         update mutable project fields
    DELETE /v1/projects/{id}         soft-delete a project
