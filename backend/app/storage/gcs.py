"""
app.storage.gcs — Google Cloud Storage provider (google-cloud-storage SDK).

The google-cloud-storage library is synchronous. All I/O operations are
offloaded to a thread pool via asyncio.to_thread() to avoid blocking the
event loop.

Authentication priority (first match wins):
  1. credentials_json — inline service account JSON string
  2. credentials_file — path to a service account JSON file
  3. ADC             — Application Default Credentials (Workload Identity, gcloud auth)

Usage:
    from app.storage.gcs import GCSStorageProvider

    provider = GCSStorageProvider(
        bucket_name="fn-project-uuid",
        credentials_json='{"type": "service_account", ...}',
    )
    url = await provider.generate_presigned_upload_url(key, content_type, size_bytes)
